# Hostinger Deployment Configuration

## Git Integration Setup
1. Log in to your Hostinger account and go to the Hosting Dashboard
2. Navigate to your hosting package and click on "Website" > "Git"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set the repository branch to: main
5. Set the public directory to: public_html
6. Set the build command to: npm install && npm run build && cp -r dist/* public_html/

## Verification Steps
1. After deployment, check if the public_html directory contains the built website
2. Access your domain to confirm the site is live
3. Check for any 404 errors when navigating between pages

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter 404 errors on route changes, ensure your server configuration files are correct
- Check that the _redirects file is correctly placed in the dist directory
- Verify that .htaccess and web.config files are properly configured
- For deep linking issues, make sure Vite's base path is set correctly in vite.config.ts

## Manual Deployment Alternative
If Git integration doesn't work, you can manually upload the dist folder contents to the public_html directory using Hostinger's File Manager or FTP.
